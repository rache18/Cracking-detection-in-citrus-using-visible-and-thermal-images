# Cracking-detection-in-citrus-using-visible-and-thermal-images
This study investigates the detection of cracking in citrus fruits, primarily utilizing vis-
ible imaging techniques, with thermal imaging incorporated in preliminary steps. Fruit
cracking poses a significant challenge to agricultural productivity causing to yield reduc-
ing. This research combines machine vision systems with image processing algorithms
to identify and classify mandarins based on cracking symptoms. The primary emphasis
is on RGB imaging for crack detection and classification accuracy, while thermal imag-
ing was partially integrated into certain RGB-based methods to examine its potential
contribution to the detection process. Techniques such as the YOLOv8 architecture and
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) were employed for image processing and analysis.
Experiments were conducted on mandarin fruits collected across different seasons to train
and evaluate the models. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
methods in detecting early-stage cracks, enabling timely interventions to minimize losses.
This research advances precision agriculture by improving fruit health monitoring and
promoting sustainable citrus orchard management
